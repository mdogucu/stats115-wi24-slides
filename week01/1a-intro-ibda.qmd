## Meet and Greet Each Other

In groups three or four meet and greet each other.

Include

Your name\
Your year\

## Why should you learn Bayesian Statistics?

## An example

"In 1985 only about 10% of JASA [Journal of the American Statistical Association] Applications and Case Studies articles used Bayesian methods.

. . .

In 2022 plus half of 2023, that percentage has changed.
It is now 49%."



Jeff Witmer, _To Bayes or Not to Bayes --
Is There Any Question?_ Talk at Joint Statistical Meetings, 2023

## Why should you learn Bayesian Statistics?

- intuitive

. . .

- draws a more complete picture of statistics from both philosophical and application perspectives

. . .

- prepares you for your future career

. . . 

- statistics and computing are used in a harmonious way


# Introduction to Bayesian Ideas

## Interpretation of Probability

**Bayesian**: a probability measures the relative plausibility of an event.

**Frequentist**: a probability measures the long-run relative frequency of a repeatable event. In fact, ‚Äúfrequentists‚Äù are so named because of their interpretation of probability as a long-run relative frequency.


## Prior Data

Consider two claims. (1) Zuofu claims that he can predict the outcome of a coin flip. To test his claim, you flip a fair coin 10 times and he correctly predicts all 10! 

(2) Kavya claims that she can distinguish natural and artificial sweeteners. To test her claim, you give her 10 sweetener samples and she correctly identifies each! In light of these experiments, what do you conclude?

a. You‚Äôre more confident in Kavya‚Äôs claim than Zuofu‚Äôs claim.

b. The evidence supporting Zuofu‚Äôs claim is just as strong as the evidence supporting Kavya‚Äôs claim.


## Hypothesis Testing

Suppose that during a recent doctor‚Äôs visit, you tested positive for a very rare disease. If you only get to ask the doctor one question, which would it be?

a. What‚Äôs the chance that I actually have the disease?  
b. If in fact I don‚Äôt have the disease, what‚Äôs the chance that I would‚Äôve gotten this positive test result?

. . .

a. $P(disease | +)$  
b. $P(+ | disease^c)$


## Notes on Bayesian History

- Named after Thomas Bayes (1701-1761).

. . .

- Frequentist statistics has been more popular historically and Bayesian statistics is starting to get popular, mainly because 

. . .

- Computing, computing, computing.

. . .

- It is harder to adopt to newer methods. Thus change is happening slowly. 

. . .

- We can embrace subjectivity.
